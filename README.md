# Ethereum-Dapp

A simple `Bank Transaction DAPP` with GUI.

***Solidity*** is the programming language used.

Metamask(Ropsten Test Network) is used for transaction fees(includes Amount+Gas fee ).



### Gas - Whenever we do a transaction , the miners want to get rewarded , so we have to pay them some fees known as Gas.

Ether is the cryptocurrency being used for transaction based on Ethereum.

Bootstrap is used for making GUI.


# Requirements

- Metamask Extension enabled on your browser.

- Account on Metamask.

- Get some free ether using any of the test network(prefer not to use Main Network as it may cost you some money for buying ether).

- Add Bootstrap CDN in your file to feel some great user experience.
